pyRSD
===================================================

*Accurate predictions for the clustering of galaxies in redshift-space in Python*


pyRSD is a Python package for computing the theoretical predictions of
the redshift-space power spectrum of galaxies. The package also includes
functionality for fitting data measurements and finding the optimal model parameters,
using both MCMC and nonlinear optimization techniques.

provides a high-level, Python user interface for
interacting with the theoretical models and
